## About Me 🌟

¡Hola! 👋 I'm José, full-stack developer living in Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸 but conquering the world remotely from my desk! 🌍  

When I'm not coding, you can find me:  
- Getting inked (tattoo enthusiast here! 🎨)  
- Hunting for the latest drops from Japanese fashion brands (my wallet fears me but my style game is strong! 👘✨)  
- Figuring out where to find Doraemon's four-dimensional pocket to fit my neverending library of design books and mangas (seriously, that blue cat had the right idea! 🐱📚)  

## Tech Skills: The Good Stuff! 💥🚀

**Fueled by JavaScript, I build full-stack wonders!** 🚀  

**Frontend:** 
React, Typescript, and Vanilla JS—and sprinkling in Three.js 3D flair for that immersive “wow” effect! 🎉  
**Backend:** 
Deno and a dash of Node.js magic to keep your APIs agile and rock-solid! ⚡  
**Design:** My secret sauce is Tailwind CSS (topping it with a pinch of creative spark in Figma that wows every user! 🌟)

## My Projects: The Lab Where Magic Happens! 🔧✨

In my spare time, I’m either polishing code or hunting for limited-edition tees—so expect these repos to be equally stylish and functional. Here are a few favorites:

### 🗳️ Qué Dice Su Programa

Qué Dice Su Programa converts dusty Spanish party manifestos into a chatty FAQ—ask “¿Qué proponen sobre vivienda?” and get an instant, citation-backed answer. Democracy with a side of NLP!

### 🗺️ Satorisan

Save a link, get a map—it’s that simple.

• Paste any Google Maps URL → AI grabs the metadata, tags it, and tucks it into your private vault.  
• Generates shareable, auto-styled maps via the Places API (road-trip planners, city guides, coffee-hunt lists—your call).  
• Blazes past bookmark chaos; all your “where was that again?” moments solved in one click.

[Live Demo](https://satorisan.vercel.app) • *Invite only!*


### 🏯 Gorosan (WIP)

Meet your friendly, silver-haired kanji mentor.

• Retrieval-Augmented tutor that chats, quizzes, and tracks your progress.  
• Proactively schedules daily drills and mnemonic stories so each character sticks.  
• Still WIP, but already writing “漢字” into my muscle memory (and soon yours).


## Fun Facts About Me! 🎉

- I once rebuilt a Doraemon gadget catalog using GraphQL—still waiting on that four-dimensional pocket PR. 🐱✨
- I colour-matched my keycaps to my BAPE Shark hoodie so precisely that passing capuchins give an approving nod. 🎹🐵
